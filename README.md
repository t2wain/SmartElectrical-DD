## Analyzing Intergraph SmartElectrical (SEL) Data Dictionaries

Each SEL project has three (3) data dictionary schema. The data dictionary store data that describes both the physical and the logical database objects of the SEL application. This project is using EntityFramework Core to analyze the data in these data dictionaries and extract the useful information to have a better understanding of both the physical and the logical model of the SEL application.

Note, the output files from the full analysis of all these data dictionaries are located here on my GitHub Hexagon-SEL repo (https://github.com/t2wain/Hexagon-SEL)
